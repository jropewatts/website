<h1 class=secondline>Welcome to DemonProjects.com</h1>
<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p class=why>This is a hub where cutting-edge software meets smart solutions! Whether you're an old-school BMS engineer or a freshly trained 
For N4 and IOT engineers or enthusiasts in smart building technology, we've crafted an experience that is tailored to you. <br>
 Our mission is to provide you with tools to take the time out of building station(supervisors) be it company templates to allow multiple
 engineers to stick to the same format every time or one-off system from subcontractors that want their own style easily with out having
 to start for scratch every time.<br>
 These tools aim to empower you to optimize your time to allow you to innovate instead of being stuck putting point by point on 
 the page or by going through 100s of pages changing one setting.<br>
Using these hand build .exe programs will allow you to change the PX page in Niagara (N4) on mass, which will save you time.
</P> 


<h1 class=secondline>Current Project</h1>
<p class=Cproject>
There are lots of products for Trend and Tridium and some are really simple, and others are overly complicated.
<br>My mission is to make tools that are simple to use so that anyone can use the software 
<br>It is mainly aimed towards user interface and makes the conversion as easy as possible 
<br>Trend 963 is no longer supported and IQVision takes too long to build. 
<br>The conversion tools take the 963 Export and quickly make it IQVision friendly 
<br>So no more red flashing text which means that the time can be used making it pretty or to finish it quicker so that you can make more money.</p>


<h1 class=secondline>The Goal</h1>
<p class=goal>
For anyone to be able to format N4 PX page quickly, one application that takes the 963Export and converts it to N4, or formats all the text to the same colour size and style, or removes popup.
<br>or more simple tools that help you use the ExpLogic control block like Combi SET block in N4</p>
